Before we get into the Halloween homeschool ideas, I have a short announcement! As I’m trying to grow the blog I’m doing what I can to create content regularly. As part of this - I plan to post every single day in October. 31 posts in 31 days for Halloween!

Many of my posts will delve deeper into the Halloween homeschool ideas listed below. Some will be short, some will be long, and if you want to come play along there should be fun here every day in honor of Halloween and the start of fall!

If you have a pumpkin patch nearby then get out and go! Otherwise visit the grocery store to pick one to carve. Since the weather in my city is looking like it might want to stay in the 90s well into October, the actual carving may want to wait until closer to trick-or-treating

## Dress up days!

In the lead-up to Halloween, let’s dress up every day! Who says homeschoolers have to miss out on spirit week?

### 27. Superhero

### 28. Silly hats

### 29. School Colors

Let the kids pick their favorite color and dress all in one shade - or if you’re like us, pick them all and go rainbow head to toe.

### 30. Book character

### 31. Halloween costumes!

In other, more personal news, My Gal Friday made a last minute-ish change of plans for her Halloween costume:

She’s very excited! I can’t deny I’m a smidge disappointed (not to say that Sailor Moon isn’t fun!) because she was originally planning on being Pikachu dressed up as Hermione and I was all about that costume. I haven’t decided if I should go with a Team Rocket costume anyway, or lean in and go with a Sailor Moon costume along with the rest of the family - especially since it occurred to me that the Young Wolf in a tuxedo onesie playing Tuxedo Mask would be really adorable and slightly less inappropriate than her dad playing the role as she originally wanted. 

I could get behind being a Sailor Moon villain like [Queen Metaria](https://sailormoon.fandom.com/wiki/Queen_Metalia_(manga))!  
  
UPDATE: I talked MGF into changing out of the Sailor Moon shirt she's been wearing the last week and a half so we could wash it. She changed into a Pokémon shirt and now she wants to be Ash... Seriously between the time I wrote this post in the early evening and when I'm posting it.
